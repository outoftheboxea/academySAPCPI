# SAP PO vs SAP CPI – Design-Time Object Comparison

This document compares **SAP Process Orchestration (PO)** design-time objects with their corresponding or equivalent components in **SAP Cloud Platform Integration (CPI)** — now part of **SAP Integration Suite**.
It highlights similarities, differences, and recent updates (as of 2024–2025) that bring CPI closer to SAP PO in design-time capability.

| **SAP PO Design-Time Object**               | **Description (SAP PO)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | **Corresponding Object in SAP CPI**                                                                     | **CPI Equivalent & Differences**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| **Data Type**                               | Defines the structure of data (simple or complex XML schema) used in messages. Data Types are the fundamental building blocks of PI/PO interfaces, describing the XML data structure (fields, elements, types). They are created in the ESR and can be reused across multiple interfaces.                                                         | **Data Type artifact** (since 2024)                                                                     | **Direct equivalent (newly introduced)** – SAP Integration Suite (Cloud Integration) now supports Data Type artifacts in design time (v6.40+), allowing you to import or create data type definitions similar to ESR. These define message structures for use in mappings. In earlier CPI versions, there was no separate Data Type object (schemas were provided ad-hoc in mapping steps), but now you can manage and reuse data structures just like in PO. No major functional differences aside from the development UI (the concept and purpose remain the same).                            |
| **Message Type**                            | Defines the structure of a message by referencing a Data Type. A Message Type in PI/PO specifies the root element of the message and its payload structure. It is used in Service Interfaces (as inbound/outbound message definitions). Essentially, the Message Type = Data Type + a root element name, representing an actual message instance. | **Message Type artifact** (since 2024)                                                                  | **Direct equivalent (newly introduced)** – SAP Cloud Integration supports Message Type design objects (v6.40+), which can be imported from PI/PO ESR or created new. A CPI Message Type serves the same purpose of defining a reusable message structure (with a root element), used for mappings and interface definition. This was added to facilitate migration and reuse of ESR content. In CPI, Message Types are used mainly in conjunction with Message Mapping steps. Functionally it’s the same concept; earlier CPI relied on inline schemas, but now you can maintain them explicitly. |
| **Service Interface (Inbound/Outbound)**    | An abstract interface definition describing a set of operations (one or more) and their message exchange pattern. In PO’s ESR, Service Interfaces (also called Message Interfaces in older terms) group request and/or response Message Types and define whether it’s inbound or outbound. These serve as the contract (WSDL) for integration.    | *No separate design-time object*                                                                        | **No direct equivalent** – CPI does **not** require a separate Service Interface object. In Cloud Integration, the interface contract is defined implicitly by the integration flow’s configuration (e.g., adapter connection or imported API definition). You can import WSDLs or schemas, but there is no central ESR repository. Each iFlow defines its own interface logic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Message Mapping (Graphical Mapping)**     | An executable mapping program that transforms a source message to a target message. In SAP PO this is often a graphical mapping defined in ESR, performing XML-to-XML transformation with functions and UDFs.                                                                                                                                     | **Message Mapping artifact**                                                                            | **Direct equivalent** – SAP Cloud Integration provides graphical Message Mapping with similar capabilities. You can create mapping artifacts in CPI and even **import ESR message mappings**. CPI supports UDFs (Groovy/JavaScript) and Function Libraries. **Differences:** CPI’s mapping runtime has minor differences in standard functions and XPath handling, but overall functionality is aligned.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Operation Mapping**                       | A mapping object linking an outbound Service Interface operation to an inbound one, specifying which mapping programs to execute. Often used for multiple operations (1:N or N:1 mappings).                                                                                                                                                       | *No standalone object (mapping logic handled in flow; limited support for imported Operation Mappings)* | **Partial equivalent** – CPI does not require a separate object to link operations. However, CPI introduced an **Operation Mapping step** (for SOAP adapter scenarios) that can import and execute a PO Operation Mapping in an iFlow. Outside SOAP scenarios, routing and mapping are handled directly in the iFlow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Function Library (Mapping UDF Library)**  | A container for reusable User-Defined Functions (UDFs) in ESR. Used to centralize mapping logic for reuse across multiple mappings.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **Function Libraries artifact**                                                                         | **Direct equivalent (recently introduced)** – As of mid-2023, CPI supports Function Library artifacts. You can create or **import PO function libraries**. Java-based UDFs are converted to Groovy. **Differences:** Some constructs (like “All values of queue”) may not import automatically. Before this feature, CPI developers copied UDFs manually. Now CPI offers true reuse similar to PO.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **External Definition (Imported XSD/WSDL)** | An external schema or WSDL imported into ESR for use as Data Types or Service Interfaces. Common for industry standards or partner integrations.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | *No separate “External Definition” artifact; use in-line or via Data/Message Types*                     | **Direct/Partial equivalent** – CPI supports importing external schemas (XSD, WSDL, EDMX, etc.) directly into integration artifacts. With new Data/Message Types, you can import XSDs similarly. **Difference:** No central repository for external docs – they are tied to specific iFlows or packages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Context Object**                          | An alias for a specific XML XPath in a message type, used in ESR for routing or mapping. Improves readability by avoiding hardcoded paths.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | *No direct equivalent*                                                                                  | **No equivalent concept** – CPI does not support Context Objects. Developers reference fields directly via XPath/JSONPath or store values in properties (via Content Modifier). CPI’s philosophy emphasizes self-contained flow logic rather than global alias definitions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Integration Process (ccBPM/BPM)**         | A Business Process model for orchestrating complex, stateful integration scenarios. In PI this was ccBPM; in PO, NW BPM (Java stack). Enables workflows, human interactions, and long-running transactions.                                                                                                                                       | *No process engine in Cloud Integration*                                                                | **No direct equivalent** – CPI lacks an internal BPM/workflow engine. Integration flows are **stateless**. For orchestrations, use **SAP Build Process Automation (Workflow Service)** or external BPM tools. Simple sequential logic can be redesigned with routing or looping, but long-running orchestration requires external workflow components.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## 📘 Summary

* **Recent updates (2023–2024)** have made CPI far closer to SAP PO’s ESR concepts with **Data Type, Message Type, Function Library, and Operation Mapping** artifacts.
* **Service Interfaces**, **Context Objects**, and **BPM Processes** remain **absent** in CPI and need redesigns or external orchestration.
* **Migration** from PO to CPI is now easier, especially with the **Integration Suite Migration Tooling** that supports ESR content import.
